  "summary": "The diff implements fixes to the authentication and connection flow for non-admin users in MainApp.tsx, useQueries.ts, and ProfileSetupModal.tsx. The changes add graceful error handling for non-approved users, a proper step-by-step auth state machine, profile setup flow for new users, and approval request handling. These changes directly address REQ-1's requirements for non-admin user login and navigation to correct screens after login, while leaving admin logic untouched.",
