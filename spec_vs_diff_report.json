  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (backend validation) and REQ-2 (frontend PledgeSection + TaskCard/TasksSection enforcement). Backend main.mo includes pledge budget cap validation. Frontend PledgeSection.tsx computes remainingBudget and shows isBudgetFull state. TaskCard.tsx and TasksSection.tsx also propagate remainingBudget and show inline errors and disabled states. All major acceptance criteria appear addressed, though the backend truncation prevents full confirmation of the exact error message wording.",

      "description": "Budget cap enforcement in TaskCard and TasksSection pledge forms (task-level pledge inputs also receive remainingBudget and enforce the cap with inline errors and disabled states)",
      "reason": "REQ-2 specifically targets the PledgeSection frontend component. The diff also applies the same budget cap UI logic to TaskCard.tsx and TasksSection.tsx, which was not requested and contradicts the non-goal of not modifying task-level budget enforcement.",
