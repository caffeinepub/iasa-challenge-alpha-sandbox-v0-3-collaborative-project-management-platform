{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that sets up providers (Theme, QueryClient, InternetIdentity) and renders MainApp with Toaster for notifications.",
  "frontend/src/components/MainApp.tsx": "Main application logic component; replaces the dual `useIsCallerAdmin` + `useIsCallerApproved` checks with a single `useGetCurrentUserStatus` call that properly routes users through the three-step onboarding: (1) `unapproved` → \"Apply for Access\" screen with submit button, (2) `pending` → \"Awaiting Approval\" holding screen with status refresh, (3) `approved`/`admin` → normal app flow with ProfileSetupModal and Dashboard.",
  "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx": "Application header with IASA branding and user profile dropdown; updated to display the user's participation level with color-coded badge and voting power prominently alongside the existing scorecards (Earned HH, Reputation, Pledged HH, Squad Role).",
  "frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx": "Footer component displaying copyright, attribution to caffeine.ai with heart icon, and version identifier \"IASA Challenge (Alpha Sandbox) v0.3\".",
  "frontend/src/components/LoginScreen.tsx": "Landing page for unauthenticated users featuring the new IASA logo from external URL, updated title \"IASA Challenge (Alpha Sandbox) v0.3\", feature highlights with icons, and Internet Identity login button.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "Modal dialog for first-time users to create their profile; replaced the squad role selector with a participation level selector showing all four levels (Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, Guest Artist) with descriptions and voting power badges, plus a role selector that filters compatible roles based on the chosen level. Passes `participationLevel` to the backend `registerUser` call.",
  "frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx": "Main dashboard with four scorecard metrics (Participation Level + Voting Power, Earned HH, Reputation, Enabler Points) and a tabbed project list; the first scorecard now prominently shows the user's participation level and derived voting power.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProjectsTab.tsx": "Displays filtered list of projects in a responsive grid layout with loading and empty states.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProjectCard.tsx": "Card component showing project summary; removed the local `showDetails` state and the `open`/`onOpenChange` props from `ProjectDetailsDialog` since the dialog now manages its own open state internally via a trigger button.",
  "frontend/src/components/CreateProjectDialog.tsx": "Dialog form for creating new projects; now imports useActor to check actor availability, disables the trigger button and all form fields while the actor is initializing, and shows a \"Connecting...\" spinner on the button until the backend is ready.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProjectDetailsDialog.tsx": "Comprehensive project details modal that manages its own open state; fixes the dialog crash by conditionally rendering the tabs content (ProjectDetailsTabs) only when the dialog is open, preventing hook/render errors when closed. Includes project status badge, resource link, and CompleteProjectButton for active projects.",
  "frontend/src/components/PledgeSection.tsx": "Pledge lifecycle section with correct `__kind__` discriminant for PledgeTarget, `confirmPledge` called with `{ pledgeId, projectId }`, and `reassignFromOtherTasks` called with `{ pledgeId, newTaskId, projectId }`.",

  "frontend/src/components/PeerRatingSection.tsx": "Peer rating interface for completed projects; `ParticipantOption` now accepts a `Principal` object directly (not a string) so `useGetUserProfile` receives the correct type, and the `RatingRow` sub-component was removed since ratings are no longer passed as a prop.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations; adds `useGetCurrentUserStatus` hook that calls `actor.getCurrentUserStatus()` returning the four-state enum (`unapproved | pending | approved | admin`), and updates `useRequestApproval` to also invalidate the `currentUserStatus` query key on success.",
