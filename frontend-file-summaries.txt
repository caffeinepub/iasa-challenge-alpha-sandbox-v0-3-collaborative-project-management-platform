  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "Modal dialog for first-time users to create their profile; replaced the squad role selector with a participation level selector showing all four levels (Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, Guest Artist) with descriptions and voting power badges, plus a role selector that filters compatible roles based on the chosen level. Passes `participationLevel` to the backend `registerUser` call.",
