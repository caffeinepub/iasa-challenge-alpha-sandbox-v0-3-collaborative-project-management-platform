After a user authenticates via Internet Identity and is confirmed to be non-admin, query their approval status and route them as follows: (a) Status = no record → show 'Apply for Access' screen where the user can submit an access request (calling the existing requestApproval backend method); (b) Status = pending → show a 'Your request is pending administrator approval' holding screen with no further actions; (c) Status = approved → proceed into the normal app flow (ProfileSetupModal if new, then Dashboard). Do not alter the admin flow, LoginScreen, Dashboard, or any other component.",
